License

Add a license file (e.g., LICENSE with MIT or another preferred license). If you want me to generate a recommended license block, tell me which license you prefer.

Notes / Next Steps I can help with

Create a polished README.md file saved to your repo.

Generate a short CONTRIBUTING.md or CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.

Produce index.html, CSS, and JS scaffolding (if you want to rebuild the site locally).

Add deployment CI/CD instructions for Netlify or GitHub Pages.
